# `Week 8 Reflection` 

The objective of this assignment focused on working with the Persons and Birthdays classes. The first prompt focused on creating a method that returns a conversational string resulting in someone's birthday, such as 23rd of April. Comparing mine with the professors I first check to see if the birthday was given to avoid an error if it isn't. I then created if, elif and else statements to give the specific endings to the birthdays. I notice in the corrected version the ending indicators are set right away if statements are created later in order to match the specific date with the proper ending. I noticed that this code is easier to read instead of creating an elif statement within the code. It reduces redundancy, and I learned that separating code into specific sections is a more organized and simpler method. 

For the second objective, I used the __lt__ method to compare two Person objects based on their first names alphabetically. The __lt__ method lets us use the < operator between Person instances. This is why I was able to compare self.first_name and other.first_name directly using the less-than operator to determine which name comes first.

The third objective of the assignment focuses on creating a mutator method in order to change the birthday month. First I check if the month number is valid by creating an if loop.  This prevents invalid months from being inputted. Then I created another if statement to check to see if the current day is valid for the new month, since each month has a different number of days. This was done by accessing the class variable days_in_month and using month-1 in order to get the correct index. If the day is invalid it will reset it to 1. When I looked at the professor’s code, it was simpler. It utilizes an if statement to check if the month is between 1 and 12 and if it is, it resets it to that month. Although, it doesn’t fix the day if it’s not valid for that month, so it could potentially create errors if the day is too high.

The last objective focuses on completing the method to return the remaining days remaining until someone's birthday. Comparing my code to the corrected version, I noticed that the corrected version shows the full calculations. In my code I utilised the days_in_year method already created in order to calculate the day number for today's date and again to calculate the day number for the birthday. This helped me keep my code clean and helped me avoid further calculations. However, the corrected version is a more detailed approach showing better step by steps. Overall, this assignment continued to help me practice working with classes and designing effective methods. I want to continue improving my work by giving more detailed code to improve clarity and also to help with simplicity.
